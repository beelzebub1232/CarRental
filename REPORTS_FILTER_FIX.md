# Reports Page Date Filter Fix

## Problem Description

The admin reports page had an issue with date filtering where:
1. Users couldn't filter by specific dates effectively
2. When creating bookings for future months (e.g., August bookings in July), the reports page wouldn't show any data when filtering for those future dates
3. The filter was only looking at `booking_date` (when the booking was created) instead of the actual rental period (`start_date` and `end_date`)

## Root Cause

The original filter logic in `app.py` was:
```python
# OLD LOGIC - Only filtered by booking_date
if start_date and end_date:
    date_filter = 'WHERE booking_date >= %s AND booking_date <= %s'
```

This meant:
- When you create a booking for August in July, the `booking_date` is set to July
- But the `start_date` and `end_date` are in August
- Filtering for August dates would return no results because `booking_date` is in July

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Filter Logic in `admin_reports()` function

**New logic filters by rental period instead of booking creation date:**

```python
# NEW LOGIC - Filters by rental period (start_date and end_date)
if start_date and end_date:
    date_filter = 'WHERE (DATE(start_date) >= %s AND DATE(start_date) <= %s) OR (DATE(end_date) >= %s AND DATE(end_date) <= %s) OR (DATE(start_date) <= %s AND DATE(end_date) >= %s)'
    params = [start_date, end_date, start_date, end_date, start_date, end_date]
elif start_date:
    date_filter = 'WHERE DATE(start_date) >= %s OR DATE(end_date) >= %s'
    params = [start_date, start_date]
elif end_date:
    date_filter = 'WHERE DATE(start_date) <= %s OR DATE(end_date) <= %s'
    params = [end_date, end_date]
```

**This logic covers three scenarios:**
1. **Start date within range**: `DATE(start_date) >= start_date AND DATE(start_date) <= end_date`
2. **End date within range**: `DATE(end_date) >= start_date AND DATE(end_date) <= end_date`
3. **Booking spans the range**: `DATE(start_date) <= start_date AND DATE(end_date) >= end_date`

### 2. Updated Popular Vehicles Query

The popular vehicles section now also respects the date filter:
```python
if date_filter:
    popular_vehicles_query = f'''
        SELECT v.make, v.model, v.type, COUNT(b.id) as booking_count
        FROM vehicles v
        LEFT JOIN bookings b ON v.id = b.vehicle_id {date_filter.replace("WHERE", "AND")}
        GROUP BY v.id
        ORDER BY booking_count DESC
        LIMIT 10
    '''
    cursor.execute(popular_vehicles_query, params)
```

### 3. Updated Export Functions

Both `export_bookings()` and `export_payments()` functions now use the same rental period filtering logic:

- **export_bookings()**: Now filters by rental period instead of booking_date
- **export_payments()**: Now filters by rental period and joins with bookings table to get start_date/end_date

### 4. Enhanced UI in Reports Template

Updated `templates/admin/reports.html` to:
- Add a clear title "Filter by Rental Period"
- Add explanatory text about what the filter does
- Show active filter status with clear indication of what's being filtered
- Add a "Clear Filter" button when filters are active

## Testing

Created and ran test script that added August bookings to verify the fix works:
- Added 5 test bookings with August 2025 dates
- Verified they appear in the database
- The reports page should now show these bookings when filtering for August dates

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Date Filtering**: Users can now filter by the actual rental period dates
2. **Future Bookings Visible**: Bookings made for future months will appear in reports when filtering for those months
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear UI indicators show what's being filtered
4. **Consistent Logic**: All report-related functions (main reports, exports) use the same filtering logic

## Files Modified

1. `app.py` - Updated `admin_reports()`, `export_bookings()`, and `export_payments()` functions
2. `templates/admin/reports.html` - Enhanced UI with better filter controls and status display

## Usage

To test the fix:
1. Create bookings for future dates (e.g., August 2025)
2. Go to Admin Reports page
3. Set date filter to include the future dates
4. Verify that the bookings appear in the reports and statistics
